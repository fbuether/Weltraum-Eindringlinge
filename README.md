# WeltraumEindringlinge

It's a game! Control your spaceship, earth last's hope of defense, and shoot down the impolites.

I develop this game for fun in my spare time, to get a proper foot into hobby-level game development.

## Playing

In the game, control your spaceship with `a` and `d` to move left or right. Fire at enemy things using space. Win by destroying everything!

## Building

To run the game in development mode, do

```
$ yarn install
$ make dev
```

or, equivalently

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run webpack-dev-server
```

You can build a distributable version, like this:

```
$ yarn install
$ make build
```

or, equivalently

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run webpack
```
